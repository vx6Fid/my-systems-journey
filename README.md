# My Systems Journey
Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my personal lab and logbook for exploring **distributed systems** through small projects and experiments.

This repo is inspired by the book *[Understanding Distributed Systems](https://understandingdistributed.systems/)* by Roberto Vitillo. It’s where I try to build real tools to better understand the theory and see how these systems work in practice.


## What’s Inside?

| Project                                  | Description                                                            | Concepts Explored            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [netvix](./netvix/README.md) | Visualizes DNS lookup times, round-trip times, and other network stats | DNS, RTT, TCP/IP, traceroute |

>*More projects coming soon*

This list will grow as I build more projects.

## Why I’m Doing This

I’m not an expert—just someone curious about how distributed systems work. Reading about them is useful, but I learn best by building, experimenting, and sometimes breaking things.

This repo helps me:

* Turn theory into working code
* Track my progress and learning journey
* Try out ideas quickly and learn from mistakes
* Possibly help others who want to explore the same topics

## Tools & Stack
Most projects use:
* Go, Bash, or Node.js (depending on the project)
* Common Linux tools like `ping`, `dig`, `traceroute`
* Basic networking libraries and protocols
* Simple visualization tools where needed

The goal is to keep things straightforward and hands-on.

## What’s Next
This is a work in progress. I plan to add:
* More hands-on tools & micro-projects
* Visual explanations & diagrams
* Blog-style writeups and reflections
* Deep dives into protocols (like NTP, Raft, DNS, etc.)

You can also check out my [blog](https://vx6fid.vercel.app/blogs) for deeper thoughts.

## Feedback?
If you have suggestions, questions, or want to discuss distributed systems, feel free to open an issue or get in touch.
